# lamb-plate

A Leiningen template for starting new AWS Lambda functions implemented in Clojure.
This template handles:

- Java interop boilerplate
- CloudWatch compatible logging using Log4j
- [Component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) based architecture
- [Reloaded development workflow](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/06/04/clojure-workflow-reloaded)
- Event stubs for testing locally
- Environment variable handling via [environ](https://github.com/weavejester/environ)

## Template Usage

Make sure you have the [latest version of Leiningen installed](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation).

Then, to create a project called `hello-lambda`:

```
lein new lamb-plate hello-lambda
```

## Project Usage

### Quick Start

Run `lein repl`. Then, to get a fresh system:

```
user=> (reset)
```

To run the Lambda function:

```
user=> (execute)
```

### Overview

You'll find the entry point of the template in the `project-name.core` namespace. Here,
we generate a class that implements the `-handle` function, which is the main entry point for AWS Lambda. Within
that function, we log out a helpful message, parse the event map, and bootstrap the
system. With the system initialized, we extract the `Handler` component, and call its
`execute` function to..._do something!_. That part is up to you.

You can find detailed information on the anatomy of this `-handle` function by visiting
[Amazon's Lambda Function Handler for Java](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/java-programming-model-handler-types.html)
documentation. In fact, you may find many of the Lambda articles for Java to be helpful to you
when trying to understand various interop scenarios.

### Reloaded Workflow and the Component Architecture

This template is set up to support Stuart Sierra's [component architecture](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) and
[reloaded workflow](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/06/04/clojure-workflow-reloaded) out of the box.
I have found that this workflow is incredibly powerful in the context of [the container model](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-introduction.html)
that AWS uses to run Lambda functions. If you're unfamiliar with these ideas, consider them required reading.

When you run `lein repl`, you will be loaded into the `user` namespace by default. This namespace is augmented
by the `dev/user.clj` file, which contains all sorts of helpers and stubs useful at development time _(this
file isn't loaded in production)_.

The `user/reset` function is the bread and butter of the reloaded workflow, and is included
in the `dev/user.clj` file. When invoked at the repl, it will:

1. Tear down all the system's components
2. Refresh all namespaces in dependency order
3. Restart all the system's components

Your repl-driven workflow will entail: exercising functions at the repl, making some code changes,
running `(reset)`, and repeat. 

### Included Components and Beyond

This template comes with two components pre-configured:

- **Handler**: contains the `project-name.handler/exectute` function, and depends on the `AWS` component
- **AWS**: encapsulates the event map, and the [Context Object](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/java-context-object.html)
both of which are passed in by the Lambda runtime environment<sup>1</sup>

The `project-name.handler/execute` function is where your custom Lambda logic will go. At this stage in the component architecture,
all other components have been started and injected; all that remains is to tie them together however you see fit.

Naturally, you'll eventually want to create new components. For example, a `Database` component, a `MemCache` component,
etc. You'll find both of the included components to be great examples for creating your own, and you're encouraged to copy them
as a starting point. Also see the [Creating Components](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component#creating-components) section
of the component project for more examples.

Once your new component is authored, you can add it to the `system` map and specify its dependencies 
within the `project-name.core` namespace. See the [Systems](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component#systems) section
of the component project for examples.

Keep in mind also that the entire `system` var is accessible to you from the `user` namespace at the repl. For example,
you can access the `Handler` component like so:

```
user=> (:handler system)
```

<sup>1</sup>_During development, this Context object is mocked with an "empty" implementation using [reify](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/reify)._

### Logging

Logging is handled by `Log4j` augmented with the [AWS Lambda custom appender](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/java-logging.html),
and is completely handled for you. You're free to make calls to the `log/*` family of functions documented in 
[tools.logging](http://clojure.github.io/tools.logging/) and they will show up in your CloudWatch logs.

You can change the log level within the `resources/log4j.properties` file. For example,
you could replace `INFO` with `DEBUG` like so:

```
log = .
log4j.rootLogger = DEBUG, LAMBDA
...
```

### JSON Event Map

Lambda functions are invoked with an event map, usually formatted as JSON. This event map contains
any information relevant to the event that triggered the Lambda (CloudWatch scheduled event, S3 object changed, etc).
When you create a Lambda function in the Java programming language, this event map is passed as an
instance of `java.util.LinkedHashMap`. Clojure, being hosted in the JVM, is no different.
To make working with this map more idiomatic, it gets immediately converted into a basic 
Clojure map with keyword keys.

So this:

```
{"name": "Robert Baratheon"}
```

Will be converted to this:

```
{:name "Robert Baratheon"}
```

And can be accessed via the `AWS` component like so:

```
user=> (:event (:aws system))
```

The conversion is implemented in the `project-name.core/linkedhashmap->map` function.

#### Event Fixture

You'll undoubtedly need to provide a stub event map while you're testing locally. You can
do this by overriding the `user/event-fixture` function, found in the `dev/user.clj` file.
This function returns a `java.util.LinkedHashMap` instance in order to mimic the Lambda
production environment as closely as possible.

### Environment Variables and Configuration

This template includes the [environ](https://github.com/weavejester/environ) library for managing
environment variables. A humble suggestion: **pass the `env` map as an argument to each component
factory function that needs it**. In other words, do **not** require `environ` in any namespace
other than `project-name.core`, the place where components are actually created. Example:

```Clojure
(defn example-component [config-options]
  (map->ExampleComponent {:option1 (get config-options :option1 :default)
                          :option2 (get config-options :option2 :other-default})
```

Now when you invoke `example-component`, you can pass the `env` map provided by environ as its
config options. Within the factory function, you can cherry-pick exactly what the component
needs from the environment.

There are many strategies for working with environment variables during development, and this template
leaves that choice up to you. You might keep them in an `environment.txt` file, and `source environment.txt`
before starting your repl. Or you might use the `.lein-env` file in your project directory. Check out
all the places that [environ](https://github.com/weavejester/environ) sources for inspiration on how
you might handle this. Either way, **be careful not to check sensitive information into your repo!**

### Temporary Files

This is more of a "bonus" tidbit, but keep in mind that the `/tmp` directory is fair game for caching valuable resources
between Lambda invocations. As noted in the [container model](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-introduction.html)
docs, a Lambda's encompassing container can be "frozen" as an optimization measure, and the `/tmp` directory stays in-tact.
You can use this to your advantage to, for example, cache auth tokens or other useful data.
